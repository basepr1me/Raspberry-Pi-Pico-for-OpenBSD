# Raspberry Pi Pico for OpenBSD

Raspberry Pi Pico for OpenBSD

The arm-none-eabi and raspberrypi-pico-sdk ports can be built and installed to
compile software for the Raspberry Pi Pico development boards. I will maintain
these here, outside of the OpenBSD ports system for anyone interested. The last
time I asked OpenBSD developers if they were interested in expanding the
arm-none-eabi port for this usage, no one responded. So, I am not going to
bother maintaining these in the ports tree.

Usage
-----

You will have to have an OpenBSD ports system in place with mystuff to build the
ports and install them. There is plenty of documentation on this.
